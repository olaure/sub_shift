## What is this?

This very basic package is a subtitle time shifter.

It allows you to globally shift your str subtitles files.


## What is it not?

This is not a subtitles editor as it doesn't allow you to edit single subtitles lines.

## What can it do?

The usage is quite straightforward

```console
$ python sub_shift.py subtitle_file.srt -o shifted_subtitles_file.str -s -5.33
```
